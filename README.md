# Covitrack

This project is created to track the COVID pandemic

## Application Structure

This application consists of mainly 2 layers:

1. A web layer `covitrack.web` which is built with Angular and acts as the repo for all the UI components
2. An API layer `covitrack.api` which is built with Python/NodeJS and acts as the repo for all the API components

This repo also has a directory `devops` which will have the files to handle the deployment of the application
